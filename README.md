# SmartWateringSystem
During my bachelors studies I followed the course interaction technology in which I together with one teammate had to make a "smart" watering system for plants. We did this by using a arduino uno linked a system we build that included a water reservoir with a straw attached to it. For this we had to develop code in C++ and we used the adruino IDE. This course included knowledge about both hardware and software.

For opening this code, please use the Arduino IDE
